# üìê Module 01 Challenge Submitted by Bonnie Faucett

## Description

In this challenge, we refactored existing code to meet a certain set of standards. In this case, we worked with an existing webpage created by a marketing agency who requested that we improve the code without changing what the code does.

## Outcomes

In the course of refactoring the existing code, we made the following improvements without changing the look of the page:
- Updated the code to utilize semantic HTML elements.
- Reorganized the HTML code to ensure it follows a logical structure, without disturbing the styling and positioning.
- Added accessible alt attributes to the icons and images to provide better accessibility for disabled page viewers.
- Updated the heading attributes to ensure they fall in sequential order.
- Edited the title (the content that appears on the browser tab) to make it concise and descriptive.
